# What are Tokens?

Tokens represent an asset or interest that has been tokenised. Tokens are popular in decentralised apps and they often represent something specific:

1. Economic Value.
2. Stake.
3. Voting rights.
4. Rewards.

More than often they are tied to function however they can also represent physical assets as well as virtual ones e.g. real estate.

## Examples of tokens

BORG - SwissBorg.

## Coins

All coins can be considered tokens, not all tokens can be considered coins. They operate as a medium of exchange.

1. Can be based on value, for example Bitcoin is designed to be used as currency.
2. Can be based on transactions – they are typically faster and cheaper with no middle man.
3. Can be built to solve specific problems – XRP ripple – cross border payment problems. Make international transactions quicker and safer using blockchain.

## Examples of coins

Ether – Ethereum.
Algarand – Algardo.
ADA – Cordano.

Coins have their own block chain whereas tokens are built on top of existing chains. Typically block chains have only one coin but several tokens.

## Examples of coins built on pre-existing chains

Uniswaps coin called uni, it is built on Ethereum and therefore called a token.

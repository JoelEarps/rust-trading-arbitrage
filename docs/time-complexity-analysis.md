# Time Complexity and Algorithm Analysis

## Time complexity of data processing

Time complexity would be O(N \* L) - where N is the number of key value pairs passed in via `raw_rates` and L is average length of the Ticker Strings - if this is constant i.e. always three/ four letters then this could be considered constant and therefore simplify to O(N).

## Time complexity of the algorithm

Time Complexity for Bellman Ford is O(V\*E) - where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of Edges.
This is Bellman because visits a vertex more than once and relaxes the vertices V-1 times.

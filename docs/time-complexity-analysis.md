# Time Complexity and Algorithm Analysis

## Time complexity of data processing

## Time complexity of the algorithm

Time Complexity for Bellman Ford is O(V\*E) - where V is the number of Vertexes and E is the number of Edges.
This is Bellman visits a vertex more than once and relaxes the Vertexes V-1 times.

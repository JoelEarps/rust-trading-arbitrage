// What is this doing - what is the purpose
// Why do we declare infinity
// Fill the vector with infinte

// Start with a weighted graph - Done
// Chose a starting vertex - in this case 0 i.e. BORG

// Relax edges one at a time from each node (therefore - 1)
// Check from source node all know distances
// Skip if they are still infinity
// Set them as distances to the nodes if you know them

// Go through the next loop of verticies
// Check from that
